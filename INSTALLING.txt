*All binaries and builds at runtime need charset.txt in the same directory as the binary.

vc binaries:
Ensure you have the VC 2008 x86 Redistributables installed
(http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=29)

mingw binaries have no external requirements.

Extract the binary archive to a directory and setup is complete.

If you wish to build from source you can either use VC++ or MSYS/mingw.  You will need both openssl and pthreads includes and libraries.

Ad-hoc binary builds are statically linked and have no external dependencies.

Source builds need:
1) g++
2) make
3) libc dev libs (libc6-dev in Ubuntu/Debian)
4) openssl dev libs (libssl-dev in Ubuntu/Debian)
5) pthreads dev libs (normally part of libc6-dev)

Runtime performance is best when built using gcc 4.4.x or 4.5.x.

Linux users
Run make and you should be finished.
For better performance add -mtune=native to the OPTIMIZATION variable in the Makefile.

*bsd users
You must use gmake instead of make at the current time.

Mac OSX users
You will need Xcode fully installed and then just run make.
Some versions of g++ will allow -mtune=native as noted for better performance
for Linux users.  If you enable the option and it fails to build then just use the Makefile as shipped.

Linux binary builds/packages
https://build.opensuse.org/package/show?package=rcracki&project=home%3Aquelrod is the head/trunk build and you may look for derived packages named similar to the release names.
