 * Fast implementation of the MD5 message-digest algorithm as per RFC

 * License: Use and share as you wish at your own risk, please keep this header ;)
 *
 * Optimizations:
 *  - For lengths < 16, transformation steps are "unrolled" using macros/defines
 *  - Constants used whenever possible, it's the compiler's job to sort them out
 *  - Padding is done on 4-byte words, and memory copied as last resort.
